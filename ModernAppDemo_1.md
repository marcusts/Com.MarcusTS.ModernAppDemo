A common interview question is, <I>"What MVVM frameworks do youu rely on for creating Xamarin apps?</I>" I simply respond, <I>"Whatever we have learned over time is, in effect, our framework."</I> This always evokes a puzzled expression.  Most IT managers, and including many architects, assume that all they have to do is grab a popular open-source MVVM Framework, and wa-la!  Their work is done. Could so many programmers be <B><I>wrong?</I></B>

When you try to implement this "easy" approach, you find that:
> * Every button, pedal, or lever is attached to another device that you have to learn to push, and that feels klunky

> * The thing drives a lot worse
> * The thing barely flies; nobody wants be the "test" pilot.
